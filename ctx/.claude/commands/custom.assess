Use the maintainable-architect agent to conduct a comprehensive maintainability assessment of this Zig-based ctx CLI project.

Analyze the current state of the codebase focusing on:

1. **Architecture & Design**:
   - Module separation and responsibilities
   - Dependencies and coupling
   - Code organization and structure
   - Parameter-driven design vs binary proliferation

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test coverage and organization
   - Test file structure and naming conventions
   - Test runner architecture
   - CI/CD integration capabilities

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Function complexity and readability
   - Memory management patterns
   - Error handling consistency
   - Documentation quality

4. **Maintainability Factors**:
   - Ease of adding new features
   - Build system simplicity
   - Development workflow efficiency
   - Container infrastructure

5. **Technical Debt & Risks**:
   - Potential maintenance issues
   - Scalability concerns
   - Documentation gaps
   - Improvement opportunities

Please provide your assessment in CSV format with the same structure as the existing reports in the reports/ directory. Each finding should include:
- Category (Architecture, Testing, Code_Quality, Documentation, Build_System, Performance, Security, Technical_Debt)
- Priority (P1=Critical, P2=High, P3=Medium, P4=Low)
- Component (specific file or area)
- Finding (brief description)
- Impact (effect on maintainability)
- Recommendation (suggested improvement)
- Effort (Small, Medium, Large)
- Status (Identified, In_Progress, Resolved)

Save the assessment to: reports/maintainability_assessment.YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.csv

Use the current ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for the filename (e.g., maintainability_assessment.2025-08-18T10-52-30Z.csv).

Focus on the current state after the recent test file restructuring and build system simplification. Consider both strengths and areas for improvement from a long-term maintainability perspective. Try as best to come up with improvements.
