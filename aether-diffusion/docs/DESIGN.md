- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Environment setup scripts
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Layer Interface Contracts

### SDK → External API
```
Interface: HTTP/HTTPS with OAuth 1.0
Data Format: XML (Yahoo Fantasy API native format)
Error Handling: HTTP status codes + custom error parsing
Rate Limiting: 3000 requests/hour per consumer key
```

### Web API → SDK
```
Interface: In-process function calls
Data Format: Language-native structs/objects
Error Handling: Exceptions/Result types
Threading: Async/concurrent safe
```

### Web Client → Web API
```
Interface: HTTP/REST API
Data Format: JSON requests/responses
Error Handling: HTTP status codes + JSON error payloads
Authentication: API keys or JWT tokens
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Yahoo API Changes**: Comprehensive API contract testing
- **Rate Limiting**: Careful rate limit handling + backoff strategies
- **Authentication**: Robust OAuth implementation + token refresh
- **Memory Usage**: Regular profiling + leak detection
- **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking + optimization

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Issues**: Blue/green deployment + rollback procedures  
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Comprehensive metrics + alerting
- **Documentation Drift**: Automated doc generation + reviews
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security scans + updates
- **Dependency Issues**: Pinned versions + security monitoring
