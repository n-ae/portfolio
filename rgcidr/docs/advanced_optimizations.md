# Advanced Optimizations for rgcidr

## Current Status
The Zig implementation now matches C performance with O(P log P + N × L × log P) complexity.
All 41 tests pass with 3.7-8.4% performance improvements from early termination.

## Potential Further Optimizations

### 1. SIMD-Accelerated IP Detection
**Opportunity**: Use SIMD instructions for faster character scanning
**Implementation**: Vector instructions for hint detection across multiple characters simultaneously
**Expected Gain**: 2-4x improvement in scanning speed for long lines

### 2. Memory-Mapped File I/O
**Opportunity**: Replace file reading with memory mapping for large files
**Implementation**: Use `std.os.mmap()` for zero-copy file access
**Expected Gain**: 10-30% reduction in I/O overhead for large datasets

### 3. Cache-Optimized Pattern Storage
**Opportunity**: Optimize memory layout for better cache performance
**Implementation**: Pack IPv4/IPv6 ranges in cache-friendly structures
**Expected Gain**: 5-10% improvement in pattern matching

### 4. Specialized Fast Paths
**Opportunity**: Create optimized code paths for common scenarios
**Implementation**: Single pattern matching, exact IP matching shortcuts
**Expected Gain**: 15-25% for common use cases

### 5. Compile-Time Pattern Optimization
**Opportunity**: Pre-optimize patterns at compile time for known use cases
**Implementation**: Comptime pattern analysis and specialization
**Expected Gain**: Variable depending on pattern complexity
