      This CDATA section contains a huge amount of raw text content that includes all sorts of special characters, symbols, and formatting that would normally need to be escaped in XML but doesn't need to be escaped here because it's in a CDATA section. This includes things like <tags>, & entities, "quotes", 'apostrophes', and other content that might confuse parsers if they're not handling CDATA properly. The goal is to create a very large CDATA section that tests memory handling for raw content sections.

      This continues with more Lorem ipsum text to make the CDATA section quite large and test how different implementations handle large blocks of raw text content within XML structures.
